**Factoring** 

To factor a polynomial is to find an equivalent expression that is a product. 
An equivalent expression of this type is called a factorization of the polynomial. 

The numbers 20 and 30 have several factors in common, among them 2 and 5. The greatest of these common factors is called the greatest common factor, GCF. 
One way to find the GCF is by making a list of the factors of each number. 

| The factors of  |                                                      |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **30**          | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30  |
| **20**          | 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20         |
| Common numbers:                       | 1, 2, 5, and 10                |

The greatest common factor GCF 
**10** 

---

Another way to find the GCF is to find the prime factorization of each number. 
Then draw lines between common factors. 

**Prime Numbers** 
Any numbers whose factors are only 1 and itself. 
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,17,19,23,……. 

**Prime Factoring** 
Breaking a number down to a product of only prime numbers.

Find the GCF of 420 and 924. 
Solution: Write the prime factorization of each number. 

| 420  |                            | 924  |                            |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| 2    | 210  | 2    | 462  |
| 2    | 105  | 2    | 231  |
| 3    | 35   | 3    | 77   |
| 5    | 7    | 7    | 11   |
| 7    | 1    | 11   | 1    |

$420 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$ 
$924 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$ 
The GCF is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 84$

**Factor: Factorization** 

-   To factor a polynomial is to express it as a product. 
-   A factor of a polynomial P is a polynomial that can be used to express P as a product. 
-   A factorization of a polynomial is an expression that names that polynomial as a product. 

Find the GCF of $30x^3, -48x^4, 54x^5$, and $12x^2$. 
**Solution** 
Prime factor of each number. 
$30x^3 = \qquad 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot x^3$ 
$-48x^4 =$ 
$54x^5 =$ 
$12x^2 =$ 

The GCF of the coefficients is 6. 
The GCF of these monomials is $x^2$, because 2 is the smallest exponent of x. 
The GCF is= $6x^2$

**Tips for factoring** 

-   Before doing any other kind of factoring, first try to factor out the GCF. 
-   Always check the result of factoring by multiplying. 

**Factoring out the GCF** 
The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the largest factor shared by all terms in the polynomial. 

Factor: $28x^6 + 32x^3$. 
**Solution** 
$28x^6 + 32x^3 = 4x^3 \cdot 7x^3 + 4x^3 \cdot 8$ Factoring each term 
$= 4x^3(7x^3 + 8)$ Factoring out the GCF, $4x^3$ 

---

Factor: $12x^5 - 21x^4 + 24x^3$ 
**Solution** 
The largest common factor is $3x^3$. 
$12x^5 - 21x^4 + 24x^3 = 3x^3 \cdot 4x^2 - 3x^3 \cdot 7x + 3x^3 \cdot 8$ 
$= 3x^3(4x^2 - 7x + 8)$ 

---

**More Examples: Self -Study** 
Factor 
1) $8x^4 - 24x^2$ = 
2) $16x^6 + 10x^3$ = 
3) $8x^5y^3 + 4x^2y^2 - 20x^3y$ = 
4) $4x^6 - 3x^3$ = 
5) $10x^4 - 5$ = 
6) $6x^3 + 9x^2$ = 
7) $4x^3 + 7$ = 

---

**Types of GCF** 
Types of GCF in Polynomials: 

-   Numerical GCF. 
-   Variable GCF. 
-   Combined Numerical and Variable GCF. 
-   Common factor with two or more terms. 

Note: If there is no common factor between the terms, the GCF is 1. 

---

**Factoring by Grouping** 
Sometime algebraic expressions contain a common factor with two or more terms. 

Example I: Factor $x^2(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)$. 
**Solution** The binomial (x + 2) is a factor of both 
$x^2(x + 2)$ and $3(x + 2)$. Thus, $x + 2$ is a common factor. 
$x^2(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = (x^2 + 3) (x + 2)$ 
The factorization is $(x^2 + 3)(x + 2)$. 

---

Factor by grouping. 
a) $3x^3 + 9x^2 + x + 3$ b) $9x^4 + 6x - 27x^3 - 18$ 
**Solution** 
a) $3x^3 + 9x^2 + x + 3 = (3x^3 + 9x^2) + (x + 3)$ 
$= 3x^2(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)$ 
$= (3x^2 + 1)(x + 3)$ 
Don’t forget to include the 1. 

---

continued 
b) $3x^4 + 2x - 27x^3 - 18$ 
$= (3x^4 + 2x) + (-27x^3 - 18)$ 
$= x (3x^3 + 2) + (-9)(3x^3 + 2)$ 
$= (x – 9)(3x^3 + 2)$ 

---

**More Examples: Self -Study** 
Factor: 
1) $x^2+2x+4x+8$ = 
2) $a^2+3a+5a+15$ = 
3) $2x^2+4x+5x+10$ = 
4) $2x^2-3x+8x-12$ = 
5) $3x^2+3x-2x-2$ = 
6) $7x^2-21x+5x-5$ =

**5.2** 
**FACTORING TRINOMIAL SQUARES and DIFFERENCES OF SQUARES** 

-   a. Recognize trinomial squares. 
-   b. Factor trinomials squares. 
-   c. Recognize differences of squares. 
-   d. Factor differences of squares, being careful to factor completely. 

---

**Trinomial Squares** 
$A^2+2AB+B^2 = (A+B)^2$ ; 
$A^2-2AB+B^2 = (A-B)^2$ 

A trinomial that is the square of a binomial is called a **perfect-square trinomial**. 

To factor a polynomial as a perfect square trinomial, the following conditions must be met: 

1.  First and third terms must be perfect squares: 
    -   The first term should be a square of some expression (e.g., $x^2, x^4, x^6$, …..). 
    -   The third term should also be a square of some number (e.g., 9, which is $3^2$). 
2.  The middle term must be twice the product of the square roots of the first and third terms: 
    -   The middle term should be equal to $2ab$, where $a$ is the square root of the first term and $b$ is the square root of the third term. 

---

Determine whether each of the following is a perfect-square trinomial. 
a) $x^2 + 8x + 16$ b) $t^2 - 9t - 36$ c) $25x^2 + 4 - 20x$ 
**Solution** 
a) $x^2 + 8x + 16$ 

1.  Two terms, $x^2$ and 16, are squares. 
2.  Neither $x^2$ or 16 is being subtracted. 
3.  The remaining term, $8x$, is $2 \cdot x \cdot 4$, where $x$ and $4$ are the square roots of $x^2$ and 16. Thus $x^2 + 8x + 16$ is a perfect-square trinomial. 

---

continued 
b) $t^2 - 9t - 36$ 

1.  Two terms, $t^2$ and 36, are squares. But 
2.  Since 36 is being subtracted $t^2 - 9t - 36$ is not a perfect-square trinomial. 

---

c) $25x^2 + 4 - 20x$ 
It helps to write it in descending order. 
$25x^2 - 20x + 4$ 

1.  Two terms, $25x^2$ and 4, are squares. 
2.  There is no minus sign before $25x^2$ or 4. 
3.  Twice the product of the square roots is $2 \cdot 5x \cdot 2$, is $20x$, the opposite of the remaining term, $-20x$. 
    Thus $25x^2 - 20x + 4$ is a perfect-square trinomial. 

---

Factor: a) $x^2 + 8x + 16$ b) $25x^2 - 20x + 4$ 
**Solution** 
a) $x^2 + 8x + 16 = x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 4 + 4^2 = (x + 4)^2$ 
$A^2 + 2 A B + B^2 = (A + B)^2$ 

b) $25x^2 - 20x + 4 = (5x)^2 - 2 \cdot 5x \cdot 2 + 2^2 = (5x - 2)^2$ 
$A^2 - 2 A B + B^2 = (A - B)^2$ 

---

Factor: $16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2$ 
**Solution** 
$16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 = (4a)^2 - 2(4a)(3b) + (3b)^2$ 
$= (4a - 3b)^2$ 

Check: $(4a - 3b)(4a - 3b) = 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2$ 
The factorization is $(4a - 3b)^2$. 

---

**Factoring a Difference of Squares** 
$A^2 - B^2 = (A + B)(A - B)$ 

The general formula for factoring a difference of squares is: 
**Factoring a Difference of Squares** 
For factoring a difference of squares, the conditions are: 

1.  Two terms: The expression must have exactly two terms (Binomial). 
2.  Both terms must be perfect squares: Each term should be a perfect square, meaning the square of some number or variable. For example, $a^2$ and $b^2$ are perfect squares. 
3.  The terms must be subtracted: The two terms must be separated by a subtraction sign (i.e., the expression should be of the form $a^2-b^2$). 

---

Factor: a) $x^2 - 9$ b) $y^2 - 16w^2$ 
**Solution** 
a) $x^2 - 9 = x^2 - 3^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$ 
$A^2 - B^2 = (A + B)(A - B)$ 

b) $y^2 - 16w^2 = y^2 - (4w)^2 = (y + 4w)(y - 4w)$ 
$A^2 - B^2 = (A + B) (A - B)$ 

---

**Factoring Completely** 
Sometimes, a complete factorization requires two or more steps. Factoring is complete when no factor can be factored further. 

Example Factor $5x^4 - 3125$. 
**Solution** We have 
$5x^4 - 3125 = 5(x^4 - 625)$  GCF 
$= 5[(x^2)^2 - 25^2]$ 
$= 5(x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25)$ 
$= 5(x - 5)(x + 5)(x^2 + 25)$ 
The factorization is $5(x - 5)(x + 5)(x^2 + 25)$. 

---

**5.3** 
**FACTORING TRINOMIALS of the Type $x^2 + bx + c$** 

-   a. Factor trinomials of the type $x^2 + bx + c$ by examining the constant term $c$. 

---

**To Factor $x^2 + bx + c$ when $c$ is Positive** 
When the constant term of a trinomial is positive, look for two numbers with the same sign. 
The sign is that of the middle term: 

$x^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 2)(x - 5)$; 
$x^2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)$; 

---

Factor: $y^2 - 8y + 15$. 
**Solution** 
Since the constant term is positive and the coefficient of the middle term is negative, we look for the factorization of 15 in which both factors are negative. 
Their sum must be -8. 

| Pairs of Factors of 15  | Sums of Factors  |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| -1, -15                 | -16              |
| -3, -5                  | -8               |
|                                                | **Sum of -8**    |

$y^2 - 8y + 15 = (y - 3)(y - 5)$ 

---

**To Factor $x^2 + bx + c$ When $c$ is Negative** 
When the constant term of a trinomial is negative, look for two numbers whose product is negative. 
One must be positive and the other negative: 

$x^2 - 4x - 21 = (x + 3)(x - 7)$; 
$x^2 + 4x - 21 = (x - 3)(x + 7)$. 

Select the two numbers so that the number with the larger absolute value has the same sign as $b$, the coefficient of the middle term. 

---

Factor: $x^2 - 5x - 24$. 
**Solution** The constant term must be expressed as the product of a negative number and a positive number. 
Since the sum of the two numbers must be negative, the negative number must have the greater absolute value. 

| Pairs of Factors of 24  | Sums of Factors  |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| 1, -24                  | -23              |
| 2, -12                  | -10              |
| 3, -8                   | -5               |
| 4, -6                   | -2               |
| 6, -4                   | 2                |
| 8, -3                   | 5                |

$x^2 - 5x - 24 = (x + 3)(x - 8)$ 

---

Factor: $t^2 - 32 + 4t$. 
**Solution** Rewrite the trinomial $t^2 + 4t - 32$. We need one positive and one negative factor. 
The sum must be 4, so the positive factor must have the larger absolute value. 

| Pairs of Factors of 3  | Sums of Factors  |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| -1, 32                 | 31               |
| -2, 16                 | 14               |
| -4, 8                  | 4                |

$t^2 + 4t - 32 = (t + 8)(t - 4)$ 

---

**Prime Polynomials** 
A polynomial that cannot be factored is considered prime. 
Example: $x^2 - x + 7$ 

Often factoring requires two or more steps. Remember, when told to factor, we should factor completely. 
This means the final factorization should contain only prime polynomials. 

Factor: $2x^3 - 24x^2 + 72x$. 
**Solution** 
Always look first for a common factor. We can factor out $2x$: 
$2x(x^2 - 12x + 36)$ 
Since the constant term is positive and the coefficient of the middle term is negative, we look for the factorization of 36 in which both factors are negative. 
Their sum must be -12. 

---

continued Factor: $2x^3 - 24x^2 + 72x$ 

| Pairs of Factors of 36  | Sums of Factors  |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| -1, -36                 | -37              |
| -2, -18                 | -20              |
| -3, -12                 | -15              |
| -4, -9                  | -13              |
| -6, -6                  | -12              |

The factorization of 
$(x^2 - 12x + 36)$ is $(x - 6)(x - 6)$ or $(x - 6)^2$ 

The factorization of 
$2x^3 - 24x^2 + 72x$ is $2x(x - 6)^2$ or $2x(x - 6)(x - 6)$ 

---

**5.4** 
**Factoring $ax^2 + bx + c, a \neq 1$: The ac- Method** 

-   a. Factor trinomials of the type $ax^2 + bx + c, a \neq 1$, using the ac-method. 

---

**The ac-Method** 

1.  Factor out the largest common factor, if any. 
2.  Multiply the leading coefficient $a$ and the constant $c$. 
3.  Try to factor the product $ac$ so that the sum of the factors is $b$. 
    That is, find integers $p$ and $q$ such that $pq = ac$ and $p + q = b$. 
4.  Split the middle term. That is, write it as a sum or difference using the factors found in step (3). 
5.  Factor by grouping. 
6.  Check by multiplying. 

---

Factor $4x^2 - 5x - 6$ 
**Solution** 

1.  First, we note that there is no common factor (other than 1 or -1). 
2.  We multiply the leading coefficient, 4 and the constant, -6: 
    $(4)(-6) = -24$. 
3.  We next look for the factorization of -24 in which the sum of the factors is the coefficient of the middle term, -5. 

| Pairs of Factors of -24  | Sums of Factors  |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| 1, -24                   | -23              |
| -1, 24                   | 23               |
| 2, -12                   | -10              |
| -2, 12                   | 10               |
| 3, -8                    | -5               |
| -3, 8                    | 5                |
| 4, -6                    | -2               |
| -4, 6                    | 2                |

continued Factor $4x^2 - 5x - 6$ 
3. 
We would normally stop listing pairs of factors once we have found the one we are after.  4. Next, we express the middle term as a sum or difference using the factors found in step (3): 
$-5x = -8x + 3x$.  5. We now factor by grouping as follows: 
$4x^2 - 5x - 6 = 4x^2 - 8x + 3x - 6$ 
$= 4x(x - 2) + 3(x - 2)$ 
$= (x - 2)(4x + 3)$  6. Check: $(x - 2)(4x + 3) = 4x^2 + 3x - 8x - 6$ 
$= 4x^2 - 5x - 6$ 
The factorization of $4x^2 - 5x - 6$ is $(x - 2)(4x + 3)$.

**SOLVING QUADRATIC EQUATIONS BY FACTORING** 

-   a. Solve equations (already factored) using the principle of zero products. 
-   b. Solve quadratic equations by factoring and then using the principle of zero products.

**Quadratic Equation** 
A quadratic equation is an equation equivalent to an equation of the type 
$ax^2 + bx + c = 0, a \neq 0$. 
Second degree equations like $9t^2 - 4 = 0$ and $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0$ are called quadratic equations. 

**The Principle of Zero Products** 
An equation $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ is true or $b = 0$ is true, or both are true. 
(A product is 0 if and only if one or both of the factors is 0.) 

---

Solve: $(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0$ 
**Solution** 
In order for a product to be 0, at least one factor must be 0. Therefore, either 
$x + 4 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$ 
We solve each equation: 
$x + 4 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$ 
$x = -4$ or $x = 3$ 
Both -4 and 3 should be checked in the original equation. 

---

continued Solve: $(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0$ 
Check: For -4: For 3: 
$(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0 \qquad (x + 4)(x - 3) = 0$ 
$(-4 + 4)(-4 - 3) \qquad (3 + 4)(3 - 3)$ 
$0(-7) \qquad \qquad \quad 7(0)$ 
$0 = 0 \qquad \qquad \quad 0 = 0$ 
True \qquad \qquad \qquad True 

The solutions are -4 and 3. 

---

Solve: $4(3x + 1)(x - 4) = 0$ 
**Solution** Since the factor 4 is constant, the only way for $4(3x + 1)(x - 4)$ to be 0 is for one of the other factors to be 0. That is, 
$3x + 1 = 0$ or $x - 4 = 0$ 
$3x = -1$ or $x = 4$ 
$x = -1/3$  $x = 4$. 

Check: For $-1/3$:  \
$4(3x + 1)(x - 4) = 0$  \
$4((3 \cdot -1/3) + 1)(-1/3 - 4) = 0$  \
$4(0)(- \text{ })$ = 0  \
$0 = 0$ 

For 4:  \
$4(3x + 1)(x - 4) = 0$  \
$4(3(4) + 1)(4 - 4) = 0$  \
$4(13)(0) = 0$  \
$0 = 0$ 

The solutions are $-1/3$ and 4. 

---

Solve: $3y(y - 7) = 0$ 
**Solution** 
$3 \cdot y(y - 7) = 0$ 
$y = 0$ or $y - 7 = 0$ 
$y = 0$ or $y = 7$ 
The solutions are 0 and 7. The check is left to the student.

**Steps for Solving by Factoring:** 

-   **Write the equation in standard form:** Ensure that the quadratic equation is written in the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$. 
-   If the equation is not already set to zero, rearrange it so that all terms are on one side of the equation. 
-   **Factor the quadratic expression:** Try to factor the quadratic trinomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ into two binomials. 
-   Look for two numbers that multiply to give $a \cdot c$ (the product of the first and last terms) and add to give $b$ (the middle term). 
-   Alternatively, you can use another factoring method, depending on the form of the quadratic equation. 
-   **Set each factor equal to zero:** Once the quadratic is factored using the principle of zero products, set each factor equal to zero. 
-   **Solve for $x$:** Solve each equation from Step 3 to find the solutions for $x$.

Solve: $x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0$ 
**Solution** This equation requires us to factor the polynomial since there are no like terms to combine and there is a squared term. 
Then we use the principle of zero products: 
$x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0$ 
$(x + 7)(x + 2) = 0$ 
$x + 7 = 0$ or $x + 2 = 0$ 
$x = -7$ or $x = -2$. 

---

continued Solve: $x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0$ 
Check: For -7: \
$x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0$  \
$(-7)^2 + 9(-7) + 14 \quad 0$  \
$49 - 63 + 14$  \
$-14 + 14$  \
$0 = 0$  \
True 

For -2:  \
$x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0$  \
$(-2)^2 + 9(-2) + 14 \quad 0$  \
$4 - 18 + 14$  \
$-14 + 14$  \
$0 = 0$  \
True 

The solutions are -7 and -2. 

---

Solve: $y^2 + 4y = 0$ 
**Solution** Although there is no constant term, because of the $x^2$-term, the equation is still quadratic. Try factoring: 
$y^2 + 4y = 0$ 
$y(y + 4) = 0$ 
$y = 0$ or $y + 4 = 0$ 
$y = 0$ or $y = -4$ 
The solutions are 0 and -4. The check is left to the student. 

---

**Caution!** We must have 0 on one side of the equation before the principle of zero products can be used. 
Get all nonzero terms on one side and 0 on the other. 

Example Solve: $x^2 - 12x = -36$ 
**Solution** We first add 36 to get 0 on one side: 
$x^2 - 12x = -36$ 
$x^2 - 12x + 36 = -36 + 36$ 
$(x - 6)(x - 6) = 0$ 
$x - 6 = 0$ or $x - 6 = 0$ 
$x = 6$ or $x = 6$ 
There is only one solution, 6. 

---

Solve: $9x^2 = 49$ 
**Solution** 
$9x^2 = 49$ 
$9x^2 - 49 = 0$ 
$(3x - 7)(3x + 7) = 0$ 
$3x - 7 = 0$ or $3x + 7 = 0$ 
$3x = 7$ or $3x = -7$ 

The solutions are 
$x = 7/3$ 
$x = -7/3$ 
$7/3$ and $-7/3$. 

---

Solve: $14x^2 + 9x + 2 = 10x + 6$ 
**Solution** Be careful with an equation like this! Since we need 0 on one side, we subtract 10x and 6 from the right side. 
$14x^2 + 9x + 2 = 10x + 6$ 
$14x^2 + 9x - 10x + 2 - 6 = 0$ 
$14x^2 - x - 4 = 0$ 
$(7x - 4)(2x + 1) = 0$ 
$7x - 4 = 0$ or $2x + 1 = 0$ 
$7x = 4$ or $2x = -1$ 
$x = 4/7$ or $x = -1/2$ 
The solutions are 4/7 and -1/2.

The Mitchells are designing a garden. The garden will be in the shape of a rectangle and have an area of 270 square feet. 
The width of the garden is 3 feet less than the length. Find the length and width. 

**Solution** 
**1. Familiarize.** We first make a drawing. Recall that the area of a rectangle is Length ⋅ Width. We let $x$ = the length, in feet. 
The width is then $x - 3$. 

$x$ 
$x - 3$ 

**2. Translate.** 
Rewording: The area of the rectangle is $270 \text{ ft}^2$. 
Translating: $x(x - 3) = 270$ 

---

**3. Solve.** We solve the equation. 
$x(x - 3) = 270$ 
$x^2 - 3x = 270$ 
$x^2 - 3x - 270 = 0$ 
$(x - 18)(x + 15) = 0$ 
$x - 18 = 0$ or $x + 15 = 0$ 
$x = 18$ or $x = -15$ 

---

**4. Check.** The solutions of the equation are 18 and -15. 
Since the length must be positive, -15 cannot be a solution. 
To check 18, we note that if the length is 18, then the width is $x - 3$ or 15 and the area is $18 \text{ ft} \cdot 15 \text{ ft} = 270 \text{ ft}^2$. 
Thus the solution checks. 

**5. State.** The garden is 18 feet long and 15 feet wide.
