### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this week's lessons, the student will be able to:

-   Graph linear equations.

### 3.1 INTRODUCTION to GRAPHING

a. Plot points associated with ordered pairs of numbers; determine the quadrant in which a point lies.
b. Find the coordinates of a point on a graph.
c. Determine whether an ordered pair is a solution of an equation with two variables.

---

### Points and Ordered Pairs

To graph, or plot, points we use two perpendicular number lines called axes.
The point at which the axes cross is called the origin. Arrows on the axes indicate the positive directions.

Consider the pair (2, 3). The numbers in such a pair are called the coordinates.
The first coordinate in this case is 2 and the second coordinate is 3.

---

### Points and Ordered Pairs continued

To plot the point (2, 3) we start at the origin.
Move 2 units in the horizontal direction.

The second number 3, is positive. We move 3 units in the vertical direction (up).

Make a “dot” and label the point.
(2, 3)

---

The horizontal and vertical axes divide the plane into four regions, or quadrants.

---

In which quadrant is the point (3, 4) located?
IV

In which quadrant is the point (3, 4) located?
III

---

**In which quadrant, If any, is each point located?**

1.  (-7,1)
    -   Second quadrant (II)
2.  (3, - 6)
    -   Fourth quadrant (IV)
3.  ( - 5, - 2)
    -   Third quadrant (III)
4.  (4,1)
    -   First quadrant (I)
5.  (0,5)
    -   Y-axis
6.  ( 8 , 0 )
    -   X-axis

---

**Find the coordinates of points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.**

**Solution**
Point A is 5 units to the right of the origin and 3 units above the origin.
Its coordinates are (5, 3). The other coordinates are as follows:

-   B: (2, 4)
-   C: (3, 4)
-   D: (3, 2)
-   E: (2, 3)
-   F: (3, 0)
-   G: (0, 2)

---

**Determine whether each of the following pairs is a solution of $4y + 3x = 18$: a) (2, 3); b)(1, 5). **

**Solution**
a) We substitute 2 for x and 3 for y.

```
4y + 3x = 18
4•3 + 3•2 | 18
   12 + 6 |
       18 | True
```

Since 18 = 18 is true, the pair (2, 3) is a solution.

b) We substitute 1 for x and 5 for y.

```
4y + 3x = 18
4•5 + 3•1 | 18
   20 + 3 |
       23 | False
```

Since 23 = 18 is false, the pair (1, 5) is not a solution.

---

### 3.2 GRAPHING LINEAR EQUATIONS

b. Solve applied problems involving graphs of linear equations.

---

**Graph $y = 3x$**

**Solution:** Find some ordered pairs that are solutions. We choose any number for x and then determine y by substitution.

| x   | $y = 3x$ | (x, y)   |
| :-- | :------- | -------- |
| 2   | 6        | (2, 6)   |
| 1   | 3        | (1, 3)   |
| 0   | 0        | (0, 0)   |
| -1  | -3       | (-1, -3) |
| -2  | -6       | (-2, -6) |

1.  Choose x.
2.  Compute y.
3.  Form the ordered pair (x, y).
4.  Plot the points.

---

**Graph $y = 4x + 1$**

**Solution:** Find some ordered pairs that are solutions. We choose any number for x and then determine y by substitution.

| x   | $y = 4x + 1$         | (x, y)   |
| :-- | :------------------- | -------- |
| -2  | $y = 4(-2) + 1 = -7$ | (-2, -7) |
| 0   | $y = 4(0) + 1 = 1$   | (0, 1)   |
| 2   | $y = 4(2) + 1 = 9$   | (2, 9)   |

(1) Choose x.
(2) Compute y.
(3) Form the pair (x, y).
(4) Plot the points.

---

**Graph $y=−\frac{3}{2}x+1$**

**Solution** Complete a table of values.

**Solution** Complete a table of values.

| x   | y   | (x, y)   |
| :-- | :-- | -------- |
| -2  | -2  | (-2, -2) |
| 0   | 1   | (0, 1)   |
| 2   | 4   | (2, 4)   |

We see that (0, 1) is a solution. It is the y-intercept.
(0, 1) is the y-intercept.

---

### 3.3 MORE with GRAPHING and INTERCEPTS

a. Find the intercepts of a linear equation, and graph using intercepts.
b. Graph equations equivalent to those of the type $x = a$ and $y = b$.

---

### Intercepts

The y-intercept is (0, b). To find b, let x = 0 and solve the original equation for y.
The x-intercept is (a, 0). To find a, let y = 0 and solve the original equation for x.

---

**Consider $5x + 2y = 10$. Find the intercepts. Then graph the equation using the intercepts.**

**Solution**
To find the y-intercept, we let x = 0 and solve for y: (Replacing x with 0 )
$5 • 0 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$
$y = 5$
The y-intercept is (0, 5).

To find the x-intercept, we let y = 0 and solve for x. (Replacing y with 0 )
$5x + 2• 0 = 10$
$5x = 10$
$x = 2$
The x-intercept is (2, 0).

---

**continued**
$5x + 2y = 10$
We plot these points and draw the line, or graph. A third point should be used as a check.
We substitute any convenient value for x and solve for y. If we let x = 4, then
$5 • 4 + 2y = 10$
$20 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$
$y = 5$

$y = 5$

| x   | y   |                    |
| :-- | :-- | ------------------ |
| 0   | 5   | y-intercept (0, 5) |
| 2   | 0   | x-intercept (2, 0) |
| 4   | -5  | Check point        |

---

### Horizontal and Vertical Lines

-   The graph of $y = b$ is a horizontal line. The y-intercept is (0, b).
-   The graph of $x = a$ is a vertical line. The x-intercept is (a, 0).

---

**Graph $y = 2$**

**Solution**
We regard the equation $y = 2$ as $0 • x + y = 2$. No matter what number we choose for x, we find that y must equal 2.

$y = 2$
Choose any number for x. y must be 2.

| x   | y   | (x, y)  |
| :-- | :-- | :------ |
| 0   | 2   | (0, 2)  |
| 4   | 2   | (4, 2)  |
| -4  | 2   | (-4, 2) |

---

**continued $y = 2$**

**Solution**
When we plot the ordered pairs (0, 2), (4, 2) and (4, 2) and connect the points, we obtain a horizontal line.
Any ordered pair of the form (x, 2) is a solution, so the line is parallel to the x-axis with y-intercept (0, 2).

---

**Graph $x = 2$**

**Solution**
We regard the equation $x = 2$ as $x + 0 • y = 2$.
We make up a table with all 2 in the x-column.

$x = 2$
x must be 2. Any number can be used for y.

| x   | y   | (x, y)   |
| :-- | :-- | -------- |
| 2   | 4   | (2, 4)   |
| 2   | 1   | (2, 1)   |
| 2   | -4  | (2, -4)  |
| 2  | 4  | (2, 4) |

---

**continued $x = 2$**

**Solution**
When we plot the ordered pairs (2, 4), (2, 1), and (2, 4) and connect them, we obtain a vertical line.
Any ordered pair of the form (2, y) is a solution.
The line is parallel to the y-axis with x-intercept (2, 0).

### 3.4 SLOPE and APPLICATIONS

a. Given the coordinates of two points on a line, find the slope of the line, if it exists.
b. Find the slope of a line from an equation.
c. Find the slope, or rate of change, in an applied problem involving slope.

---

We have looked at two forms of a linear equation,
$Ax + By = C$ and $y = mx + b$

We know that the y-intercept of a line is (0, b).
$y = mx + b$
The y-intercept is (0, b).

What about the constant m? Does it give certain information about the line?

---

### Slope

The slope of the line containing points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by
$m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

Graph the line containing the points (4, 5) and (4, 1) and find the slope.

---

The slope of a line tells how it slants.
A line with a positive slope slants up from left to right.
The larger the slope, the steeper the slant.
A line with a negative slope slants downward from left to right.

---

It is possible to find the slope of a line from its equation.

**Determining Slope from the Equation $y = mx + b$**
The slope of the line $y = mx + b$ is m.
To find the slope of a nonvertical line, solve the linear equation in x and y for y and get the resulting equation in the form $y = mx + b$.
The coefficient of the x-term, m is the slope of the line.

---

**Find the slope of the line.**
a. $m = 4$ = Slope
b. $m = \frac{2}{3}$ = Slope
c. $y = x + 8$
$m = 1$ = Slope
d. $m = 0.25$ = Slope

---

**Find the slope of the line $3x + 5y = 15$.**

**Solution**
We solve for y to get the equation in the form $y = mx + b$.
$3x + 5y = 15$
$5y = –3x + 15$
$y=−\frac{3}{5}x+3$
The slope is $−\frac{3}{5}$

---

**Find the slope of the line $y = 3$**

**Solution**
Consider the points (3, 3) and (2, 3), which are on the line.
$m = \frac{3 - 3}{2 - (3)} = \frac{0}{5} = 0$
A horizontal line has slope 0.

---

**Find the slope of the line $x = 2$**

**Solution**
Consider the points (2, 4) and (2, 2), which are on the line.
$m = \frac{4 - (2)}{2 - 2} = \frac{6}{0}$
The slope of a vertical line is undefined.

---

**More Examples: Self -Study**
Find the slope and y-intercept of the line

-   $y+3x=5$
-   $x+2y=6$
-   $−x+2y=6$
-   $y=4x−2$
-   $6x=4x−2$
-   $y=−5y+3$
