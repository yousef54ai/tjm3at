        "−23",
        "23"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correct! When adding numbers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger (15 − 8 = 7) and keep the sign of the larger absolute value. Since |−15| > |8|, the answer is negative: −7. This skill is used constantly when simplifying algebraic expressions.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Correct! Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive: 6 − (−9) = 6 + 9 = 15. This 'subtract equals add the opposite' rule is essential throughout all of algebra, especially when working with polynomials and rational expressions.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! When multiplying two numbers with the SAME sign, the result is positive. (−6)(−5) = 30. Remember: same signs → positive, different signs → negative. This rule is critical for factoring, expanding expressions, and solving equations.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! Same signs give a positive result: −48 ÷ (−6) = 8. Division follows the same sign rules as multiplication. This is crucial when simplifying rational expressions and solving equations in later chapters.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Correct! Using a(b − c) = ab − ac: 5(2x − 3) = 5(2x) − 5(3) = 10x − 15. The distributive property is THE most important skill in algebra—used in solving equations, factoring, multiplying polynomials, and simplifying rational expressions.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! Distribute the −3 to both terms: −3(4x) + (−3)(7) = −12x − 21. When distributing a negative, both terms inside change signs. This appears constantly when solving equations and factoring.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correct! Combine the coefficients: 8 − 5 + 3 = 6, so the answer is 6x. Like terms must have identical variables with identical exponents. This is essential for simplifying expressions throughout the course.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correct! Combine like terms separately: (7x² − 2x²) + (3x + 5x) = 5x² + 8x. You cannot combine x² terms with x terms—they're unlike terms. This skill is critical for polynomial operations in Chapters 4 and 5.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! The negative sign in front acts like −1: −1(3x − 8) = −3x + 8. All signs inside change. This appears constantly when solving equations, simplifying expressions, and working with polynomials.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! Follow PEMDAS: multiply first (3 × 4 = 12), then left to right: 20 − 12 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10. Order of operations is fundamental to all algebraic simplification.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correct! Subtract 12 from both sides: x = 35 − 12 = 23. This addition principle (adding or subtracting the same value from both sides) is the foundation for solving ALL equations throughout the course.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correct! Step 1: Subtract 8 from both sides → 3x = 18. Step 2: Divide by 3 → x = 6. Two-step equations are the most common type you'll encounter. Always isolate the variable term first, then divide.",
