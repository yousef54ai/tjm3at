Hmm, let me verify option A by expanding: (2m-1)(m+1) = 2m^2$ + 2m - m - 1 = 2m^2$ + m - 1. That doesn't match. Let me recalculate the GCF step. 6m^2k - 3mk - 3k = 3k(2m^2$ - m - 1). Now factor 2m^2$ - m - 1. ac = -2, need sum -1: that's -2 and 1. Split middle: 2m^2$ - 2m + m - 1 = 2m(m-1) + 1(m-1) = (2m+1)(m-1). So answer should be 3k(2m+1)(m-1), which is option B.
