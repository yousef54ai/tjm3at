Let me try: 2m² - m - 1, ac = -2, need factors that add to -1: -2 and 1. 2m² - 2m + m - 1 = 2m(m-1) + 1(m-1)? That gives (2m+1)(m-1). Hmm, let me verify option A by expanding: (2m-1)(m+1) = 2m² + 2m - m - 1 = 2m² + m - 1. That doesn't match. Let me recalculate the GCF step. 6m²k - 3mk - 3k = 3k(2m² - m - 1). Now factor 2m² - m - 1. ac = -2, need sum -1: that's -2 and 1. Split middle: 2m² - 2m + m - 1 = 2m(m-1) + 1(m-1) = (2m+1)(m-1). So answer should be 3k(2m+1)(m-1), which is option B.
